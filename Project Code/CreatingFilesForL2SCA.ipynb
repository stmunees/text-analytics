       "\"Nice Find!\\n\\nWe just happened on this restaurant during the lunch hour while taking a walk (far off the strip near our hotel). It has a Jamaican theme to most of its dishes. I had coconut shrimp that was to die for (though only four, needed at least two more) and the house salad with the house dressing (very fancy, delicious salad). My companion had a jerk chicken sandwich and soup (can't remember what kind) he said was good. Lovely atmosphere (played island music) and nice wait staff. Lots of rum specialty drinks in the offerings, but since it was 90 degrees and we had to walk a bit, we didn't indulge. I'd go back for sure!\""
