      "She put beautiful highlights and lowlights on my hair. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she did EXACTLY what it looked like on my hair. No one ever could've done that because I have super thick, coarse hair that colors or bleach usually don't go in very easily. On top of that, I have a ton of hair which took Sara 3 hours to put high and low lights! She is very thorough. I don't think anyone was this immaculate putting color on my hair. She makes sure everyone leaves the salon happy but she would never do anything to damage or ruin your hair. I saw Sara's beautiful platinum blond work on someone and it was so shiny and healthy looking. \n",
      "Not only she is very talented, her personality is amazing!! I always get a little nervous spending hours in hair salons and  having conversation with hair stylists (Well, I'm a foreigner and my English isn't that great.) BUT Sara made me feel comfortable and I enjoyed talking to her so much. Such a cheerful, happy person. Also, she is packed with all kinds of information I can keep talking to her for hours. Lots of laughter. I freaking love this girl!!\n",
      "Only thing... one time I came in for my appointment which I made a month prior and they told me I never had any appointment so I had to get my color done from someone else. (Impossible because I always made next appointments before I left the salon and I even had a card they gave me with the date and the time on it.) Well, not a big deal I guess but I was bummed out. A little. (4.5)\n",
      "Anyways, this hair salon is amazing overall. If you are looking for great hair cut and stylist, Michi is fantastic. I saw a lot of Michi's amazing hair cutting and styling works on people. She's so sweet. Tonya at the front always warmly welcomed me and asked me if I need water, coffee or sangria made by Sara on Saturdays!) Everyone is so nice and friendly in this salon. Very family feel and comfortable.\n",
